"""The new-form command tree (netctl#1469), lowered to the flat form the manifest model validates.

A task is a template; a command is an instance of one; a group is a slot in the CI/CD tree the platform
owns. This module is the whole of that model's front end: it merges a product's tree onto the kernel's,
resolves each command's `task:` into the `impl:` the rest of the loader already understands, and emits
exactly the two structures `_ManifestModel` accepts - a `taxonomy:` mapping and a flat `group path ->
members` mapping.

Lowering rather than replacing is deliberate. `CommandSpec`, `Manifest`, the six validation rules,
`taskgen` and `delivery.cli.assemble` all keep working on shapes they already consume, which is what
lets every migration step be proved by a zero-diff on the product's CLI-surface golden.

Pure functions over plain dicts: no pydantic, no I/O, no import of any body.
